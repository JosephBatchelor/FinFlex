### Product description
The artifact created is an open banking web application that utilizes both client-side and server-side code as well as an integrated
RESTful API. It does this to securely retrieve clients personal banking data and process these banking data into visualized charts 
and information. The management system provides detailed analytics and information into the clientsâ€™ accounts.

areas that contributed to my requirements and the final design of my application.

#### - N-Tier client server style

#### - REST architectural style

#### - Client server style
